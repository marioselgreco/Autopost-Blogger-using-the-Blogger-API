This script is a Python program for automating the creation of blog posts on Blogger using the Blogger API. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

Imports: It imports necessary modules such as csv, html, time, random, logging, and components from the Google API client library for Python (googleapiclient).
OAuth 2.0 Setup: It sets up OAuth 2.0 for authentication with the Blogger API. You need to provide your CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET obtained from the Google Developer Console.

Function Definitions:
create_post: Creates a new post on a Blogger blog with the given title, body, labels, and search description.
parse_html_body: Parses the HTML body of the blog post to ensure proper formatting.
create_post_with_retry: Retries creating a post if it fails for a maximum number of attempts specified by max_retries.
process_blog_from_csv: Reads a CSV file containing blog post data (title, body, labels, search description) and creates posts on the specified Blogger blog.

Main Function (main): It defines a list of mappings between Blogger blog IDs and CSV file paths. For each mapping, it calls process_blog_from_csv to create posts on the corresponding blog.
Execution: It runs the main function if the script is executed directly.

To use this script, you need to replace placeholders like add your id, add your secret, add your blog id, and add your csv file with your actual credentials and data. Then, you can run the script to automatically create posts on your Blogger blog using the content provided in the CSV file.
